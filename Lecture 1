# what is an Optimization Model?---------------consider you are a theft
- an objective function that is to maximized or minimized------- maximum the value that you can take from the house
- constrain: the limited weight that i can take by my bag
  
## knapsack Problem:
- 0/1 Knapsack Problem:
    - each item is represented by a pair <value,weight>
    - the knapsack can accommodate items with a total weight no more than w;
    - A vector L , length n , represent a set of item.
    - A vector V , length n, inidcate whether each item is taken or not
    
## If the worst of a problem is not exponential , thereis no better solution for this problem.
- use greedy algorithm :
    - the complexity will be nlogn
    - steps:
      1) sort for the best
      2) choose from the set that is not excceed cost .
      
### why greedy not always the best solution for the probklem , 
  - regulation : always increase, no decrease, if only a way to decrease, stop on a peak 
  - the peak stop is not the glob peak for the solution
